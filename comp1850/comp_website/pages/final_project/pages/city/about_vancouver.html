							Vancouver is also well-known by been a green city, both for having many trees and parks as for its policies regarding sustainability.
						</p>
						<h3>Vancouverites</h3>

							<legend>Vancouver Ethnicity</legend>
							<img src="../../images/the_city/ethnicity-thumb-300.jpg">

						</div>
						<p>
							The city of Vancouver has about 600 thousand people while the metropolitan region has up to 2.4 million residents. These numbers make Metro Vancouver one of most density regions in Canada, with Vancouver having 5,249 people per square km.
						</p>
						<p>
							The ethnic of the city is quite mixed whit about half of people having descendency or being immigrants. Because of this, Vancouver is a multicultural city, where many languages are spoken, including in government services such as 911. The largest immigrant group in the city are the Chinese.
						</p>
						<h3>Weather: Too much cold, too much hot?</h3>
						<div class="paragraph-img img-gallery"
							onclick="createCarouselGallery('vancouverWeather','aboutVancouverGallery')">

						<p>
							Not that cool and not that hot. Vancouver is one of the most moderated cities in Canada regarding to weather. Of course, during the winter it will have some cold days, with temperatures under zero  Celsius degree and snow. But comparing to other major cities in Canada, the average temperature either in winter and summer are moderated. What you really need to care about Vancouver is the raining. Not wonder, Vancouver is also known as "Raincouver". 
						</p>
						<p>
							But again, is not that bad. Vancouver "just" occupy the 9th position in the "Most raining cities in Canada". Anyway, it is better to be prepared to use some umbrellas. And remember, Vancouver is in Canada: When it said that here is not that cold it is compared with other places in Canada. It does not mean that looks like a tropical beach.
