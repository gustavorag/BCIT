						<dd>The CNN site has an efficient layout. The latest trend or news is featured prominently on the top of the content and many articles about it can be found in the following areas under it. Therefore, it is easy to find news about the last events. The website has also a small and simple, but effective area to short news about live events and the user can access more information by clicking on the short news. The navigation bar is also simple but effective and gives the users the option to find articles by categories, searching by keywords as well as by different regions of the world. Thus, navigation through the CNN site is easy, clean and objective.</dd>

					<dt>Layout</dt>
						<dd>I like this layout because I think it is very clear and effective. As a website for food establishments needs more showing than informing, this type of layout, with photos, graphics, and big fonts, is very effective. Through the main page, the user can have a good idea about the establishments and different ways to navigate. For example, the user can access "Menu" on the nav bar or can scroll down and access this same section in the photos of products, on the main page. Although the menu section has some problems regard to images, the main idea, about the general layout, looks pleasant to me.</dd>

				<a id="tips"><h2>Avoiding Usability and Accessibility problems</h2></a>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h3>Color choice</h3>
						<p>Don't choose colors just by your liking. To have a good usability, websites must have a good and compatible color pattern. Pay special attention to background colors and font color. The contrast must be enough to a pleasant reading.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Allways use Semantic tags</h3>
						<p>It is very important to use the right tags to display each type of information. For example, titles must use "h" tags, a group of items must use list tags, links must use "a" tag (avoid using images with "on click" solution). This is important because it will help search engines to find your site as also help website readers for people with disabilities. The tag with semantic is by itself a piece of information on your website. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Use conventions</h3>
						<p>Conventions are good because they follow good practices and users' customs. For example, login, shopping carts, and information about users' account usually are on the right top of websites, therefore: users will look for it there.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Always use "alt" attribute on your images</h3>
						<p>It will increase the efficiency of search engines that try to find images on the web and will help website readers to better describe your website to people with disabilities.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Avoid distractions</h3>
						<p>If your website has texts so avoid distracting things such as animated GIF or other elements that can take the attention of the user. Areas for texts must be clean.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Take advantage on CSS</h3>
						<p>Use CSS to make your links more distinguishable and attractive. For example, change background colors, font color, and other visual characteristics when the user is with the mouse over the link.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Text formating</h3>
						<p>Do not use centralization large blocks of text. Prefer to use left align.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Components' organization</h3>
						<p>Do not put your component anywhere. Instead, organize them in vertical and horizontal well-aligned block. Do not put too much space between the components neither put them close together. Find nice space between them.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Fonts</h3>
						<p>Do not use lots of font-faces and do not use fonts that are difficult to read.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Repetition</h3>
						<p>Do not greatly alter the patterns, layouts, and visuals on your site. Prefer to repeat color schemes, components formats, etc to make everything more familiar to the users. Avoid making each page a new experience to them.</p>
					</li>
